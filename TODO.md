# TODO List for Link Shortener Project

## 1. Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize a new Django project (`django-admin startproject link_shortener`).
- [ ] Create the following Django apps:
  - [ ] `api` for handling URL shortening functionalities.
  - [ ] `accounts` for managing user authentication and custom user model.
  - [ ] `core` for any shared functionality across the project (optional).
- [ ] Install Django REST Framework (`pip install djangorestframework`).
- [ ] Install `django-allauth` for user authentication (`pip install django-allauth`).
- [ ] Configure the project settings:
  - [ ] Add the new apps (`api`, `accounts`, `core`) and `rest_framework` to `INSTALLED_APPS`.
  - [ ] Configure `django-allauth` for authentication setup.
  - [ ] Configure `AUTH_USER_MODEL` to use a custom user model.

## 2. Custom User Model Setup
- [ ] Create a custom user model in the `accounts` app:
  - [ ] Subclass `AbstractBaseUser` and `PermissionsMixin`.
  - [ ] Implement custom user manager for creating users and superusers.
  - [ ] Define fields such as `email` (as the username), `first_name`, `last_name`, and `is_active`.
- [ ] Apply migrations to create the custom user model in the database (`python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`).
- [ ] Update authentication backends in settings to use `django-allauth` for authentication.
- [ ] Test user creation and authentication to ensure everything is set up correctly.

## 3. Model Creation for URL Shortening
- [ ] In the `api` app, create the `ShortenedURL` model to store original and shortened URLs.
- [ ] Add a method to generate random short URLs.
- [ ] Apply migrations to create the model in the database (`python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`).

## 4. Serializer
- [ ] Create a `ShortenedURLSerializer` in the `api` app to handle JSON serialization and deserialization.

## 5. Views Development
- [ ] Implement a `shorten_url` view in the `api` app to handle URL shortening (POST request).
- [ ] Implement a `redirect_to_original` view in the `api` app to handle redirection (GET request).

## 6. URL Configuration
- [ ] Configure URL patterns for the `api` app:
  - [ ] Add the `shorten_url` and `redirect_to_original` views to `api/urls.py`.
- [ ] Configure the project-level `urls.py` to include the `api` and `accounts` app URLs.

## 7. Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for the custom user model in the `accounts` app.
- [ ] Write unit tests for the `ShortenedURL` model.
- [ ] Write API tests for the `shorten_url` endpoint.
- [ ] Write API tests for the `redirect_to_original` endpoint.
- [ ] Ensure test coverage is above 80%.
- [ ] Run the tests (`python manage.py test`) and fix any failing tests.

## 8. Frontend Integration (Optional)
- [ ] Create a simple HTML template for URL input and displaying shortened links.
- [ ] Use Django templates to serve the frontend interface.
- [ ] Connect the frontend form with the REST API.

## 9. Environment and Security Setup
- [ ] Create a `.env` file for environment variables (e.g., database credentials).
- [ ] Add a `.gitignore` file to exclude sensitive files like `.env` and compiled files.
- [ ] Configure Django settings to use environment variables.

## 10. Dockerization (Optional)
- [ ] Create a `Dockerfile` for the Django application.
- [ ] Write a `docker-compose.yml` file to run the application with a database service.
- [ ] Test the Docker setup by building and running the containers.

## 11. Continuous Integration (CI)
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing on every push.
- [ ] Configure the CI pipeline to run the tests and check for code quality.

## 12. Deployment
- [ ] Choose a cloud provider for deployment (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).
- [ ] Configure the deployment environment (e.g., database settings, allowed hosts).
- [ ] Deploy the application using a suitable method (e.g., Docker, Git-based deployment).
- [ ] Test the live application to ensure everything is working correctly.

## 13. Monitoring and Maintenance
- [ ] Set up logging and monitoring for the application.
- [ ] Configure error reporting (e.g., Sentry).
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies and security patches.
- [ ] Monitor server performance and make optimizations as needed.

## 14. Additional Features (Future Improvements)
- [ ] Add analytics to track link usage (e.g., number of clicks, geographical location).
- [ ] Implement user authentication for managing personal links.
- [ ] Add support for custom short URL aliases.
- [ ] Implement link expiration functionality.
- [ ] Generate QR codes for shortened links.

## 15. Documentation
- [ ] Write comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger or Postman.
- [ ] Update the README file with setup instructions and usage examples.
- [ ] Provide a troubleshooting section for common issues.

## 16. Code Review and Cleanup
- [ ] Review the code for any hard-coded values or magic numbers.
- [ ] Refactor code to improve readability and maintainability.
- [ ] Ensure proper use of comments and docstrings.
- [ ] Finalize code formatting using a linter (e.g., Flake8).
